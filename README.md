Documentation for Grant Aerona3 and Chofu air-source heat pumps
===============================================================

This repository contains manuals and information for the R32-based air
source heat pumps manufactured by
[Chofu Seisakusho Co. Ltd.](https://www.chofuglobal.com/) in
[Japan](https://www.chofu.co.jp/).
In the UK, Ireland and France they are rebranded by Grant as the Aerona3
heat pumps, while in other markets distributors sell them with the Chofu
brand.

Due to differing national standardisation criteria, environmental
conditions, and possibly software and settings, the exact specifications of
the units vary between countries.  Not all models are offered in all
markets.  However there are a number of distinct chassis:
